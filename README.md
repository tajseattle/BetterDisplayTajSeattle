## About BetterDisplay

**BetterDisplay** is a truly wonderful tool! It lets you convert your displays to **fully scalable screens**, manage **display configuration overrides**, allows **brightness and color control**, provides **XDR/HDR brightness upscaling** (extra brightness beyond 100% for compatible XDR or HDR displays on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs - multiple methods available), **full dimming** to black, helps you **create and manage virtual screens** for your Mac, create **Picture in Picture** windows of your displays and gives you a host of other features to **manage your display's settings** like display and color mode easily from the menu bar. It can even **disconnect/reconnect displays** on-the-fly!

## Compatibility

- The latest v3.x version of the app is compatible with all **Apple Silicon** and **Intel** Macs running macOS **Sequoia**, **Sonoma**, **Ventura** (13.2 or newer).
- The latest stable v2.x version of the app supports macOS **Sonoma**, **Ventura** and **Monterey** (12.4 or newer).
- The v1.x app version is compatible with macOS **Monterey**, **Big Sur**, **Catalina** and **Mojave**.
- XDR/HDR upscaling requires an Apple XDR display (built-in or external) or a natively connected external HDR display (VESA DisplayHDR 600 or higher recommended).
- The display connect/disconnect feature requires an Apple Silicon Mac running at least macOS Ventura or an Intel Mac (all macOS versions supported - on Intel the feature is experimental only). External display sleep/suspend on disconnect is available only on Apple Silicon (on Intel, dimming or DDC backlight off is available for third party displays - backlight off works for Apple and built-in displays).
- Flexible scaling requires macOS Monterey 12.4 (or newer) and natively connected displays. For Intel all macOS versions work.
- Maximum flexible scaling resolutions depend on GPU capabilities and the display's resolution (horizontal width limit is 6144 pixels for entry level Apple Silicon Macs, 7680 pixels for the Pro/Max/Ultra versions).
- External display hardware backlight control and volume control require DDC capable, natively connected display or an Apple display. Some docks and dongles may not support DDC. All built-in ports of all Macs that can run the app are supported for DDC communication.
- The app is compatible with headless Macs to create custom virtual screen resolutions for remote access.
