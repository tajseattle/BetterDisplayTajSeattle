<i>Please note that this comparison is only meant to give you a big picture, does not contain all secondary and derived functionalities (free or paid) for each software, may not be up-to-date and may not be a fair representation in every respect as I am not an expert on the alternative apps. I am pretty sure the devs of respective alternatives would feel the comparison is skewed in some way or I did miss an important aspect or unique advantage of the competing solution. For an educated decision you might want to try all apps that offer some sort of trial. If you feel the comparison is not fair, drop me a note at the [BetterDisplay Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp)!</i>

1. Open the DMG file and move the app to Applications folder on your Mac as instructed.
1. Start the app.
1. Use the app menu bar item to interact with the app.

## Using the app

A new [User's Guide](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki) is under construction to explain all the features. Some useful guides are already available covering some of the more popular features of the app. More to come - please stay tuned!

Until the Wiki/Guide is complete, you can search for answers under [Discussions](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/discussions) and the BetterDisplay [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp) (it has an extensive history, most questions have been asked and answered several times over).

## Compatibility

- The latest version of the app is compatible with all **Apple Silicon** and **Intel** Macs running macOS **Ventura**, **Monterey**, **Big Sur**, **Catalina** or **Mojave** (at least 10.14.6 required).
- XDR/HDR upscaling requires an Apple XDR display (built-in or external) or a natively connected HDR display (VESA DisplayHDR 600 or higher recommended) and an Apple Silicon Mac.
- The display connect/disconnect feature requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Ventura.
- Native smooth scaling requires macOS Ventura or Monterey 12.4 (or newer) and natively connected displays on Apple Silicon. For Intel there is no such limitation.
- Maximum native smooth scaling resolutions depend on the GPU capabilities and the display's resolution (horizontal width limit is 6144 pixels for M1/M2, 7680 pixels for M1/M2 Pro/Max/Ultra).
- External display hardware backlight control and volume control require DDC capable, natively connected display or an Apple display. Some docks and dongles may not support DDC. All built-in ports of all Macs that can run the app are supported for DDC communication. 
- The app is compatible with headless Macs to create custom dummy resolutions for remote access.
